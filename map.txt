minimap img size = (HEIGHT / 4) ^ 2

1 square = (HEIGHT / 4) / gen->map->height
or 
1 square = (HEIGHT / 4) / gen->map->width
deppending on which is smaller
max sqaure = 32x32
min square = 4x4

player = (HEIGHT / 8)
player max = 8x8
player min = 4x4

if 1 square <= player size
	hide player from minimap
	highlight square instead
